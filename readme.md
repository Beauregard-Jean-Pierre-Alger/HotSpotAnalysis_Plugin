4. pysal
5. pyshp
	
Considering the system is installed with python, lets continue with the other packages. 
Download the files according to your python version and 32 bit or 64 bit operating system

`
Numpy : https://pypi.anaconda.org/carlkl/simple/numpy/
`

`
Scipy : https://pypi.anaconda.org/carlkl/simple/scipy/
`

Note: For example, in filename "numpy-1.10.0b1-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl " cp34, amd64 depicts python 3.4 and 64 bit Operating system
		
###Package Installation :
####Ubuntu Operating System
Open Terminal Window and type the commands for the following package installations. 

To Install python-numpy:

`
sudo apt-get install python-numpy
`

To Install python-scipy:

`
sudo apt-get install python-scipy
`

To Install pysal:

`
sudo pip install pysal
`

To Install pyshp:

`

And change the directory where the downloaded packages are stored and 
type the following command:


> pip install numpypackagename


> pip install scipypckagename
				

Note:  Extension should be included with the filename


Now we will continue with other packages 

`
pysal:  
	>pip install pysal
`

`
	pyshp:
	>pip install pyshp
`
